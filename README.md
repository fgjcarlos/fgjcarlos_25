# Portfolio Renovation with Astro, Tailwind CSS & DaisyUI


This project is a complete renovation of my personal portfolio, built using:

- [Astro.js](https://astro.build/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)
- [astro-icon](https://github.com/natemoo-re/astro-icon) (icon library)
- [@fontsource/lxgw-wenkai-mono-tc](https://fontsource.org/fonts/lxgw-wenkai-mono-tc) (font)

The goal is to create a modern, fast, and visually appealing website to showcase my work and skills.
